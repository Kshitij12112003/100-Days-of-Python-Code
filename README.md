# 💻 100 Days of Code: Python & Full-Stack Web Dev Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code Challenge**, running from **April 1 to July 9**!  
In this repository, I’m documenting my journey through an intensive Python and Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp. Every day, I learn something new — and then build a **project** to apply it.

This challenge includes **100+ real-world projects**, spanning automation, web scraping, game development, GUI apps, data science, APIs, and full-stack web apps.
